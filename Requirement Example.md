# Feature: User Authentication

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

- As a new user, I want to create an account with a username, email, and password so that I can access the application.  
  Acceptance Criteria: Account is created only if the email is unique and password meets security policy.

- As an existing user, I want to log in with my email and password so that I can access protected features.  
  Acceptance Criteria: Login succeeds only if credentials are valid; otherwise, a clear error message is shown.

- As a logged-in user, I want to log out so that my session is terminated.  
  Acceptance Criteria: Session tokens are invalidated immediately upon logout.

## Functional Requirements

- System must support account creation with validation for email uniqueness and password complexity.
- System must authenticate users by validating credentials against stored, hashed passwords.
- System must issue a JWT token upon successful login.
- System must invalidate JWT tokens when the user logs out.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with a configurable salt factor.
- Tokens must expire automatically after 24 hours.
- Authentication service must handle at least 500 concurrent login requests.

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

- Registration with an already registered email must return a conflict error.
- Login with invalid credentials must return an unauthorized error without revealing which field was incorrect.
- Expired or tampered JWT tokens must be rejected gracefully with an appropriate error.
