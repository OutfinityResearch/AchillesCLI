# DS010-ecosystem-integration

## Introduction
This DS defines the required integration boundaries for AchillesCLI across the local ecosystem repositories used in development and runtime workflows.

## Core Content
Integration scope:
1. AchillesCLI is a runnable CLI/runtime repository.
2. AchillesAgentLib provides the core agent runtime primitives consumed by AchillesCLI.
3. Ploinky provides workspace/runtime orchestration where AchillesCLI can be enabled and executed.
4. AchillesIDE provides a related multi-agent workspace/IDE surface whose contracts shape interoperability expectations.

Portable integration references (any environment):
1. Ploinky repository: `<workspace-root>/ploinky`
2. AchillesAgentLib installation path: `<ploinky-root>/node_modules/achillesAgentLib` (or equivalent dependency root resolved by runtime config)
3. AchillesIDE repository: `<workspace-root>/.ploinky/repos/AchillesIDE`

AchillesAgentLib contract:
1. AchillesCLI imports and uses `MainAgent`, `LLMAgent`, and related runtime helpers.
2. AchillesCLI delegates skill discovery/orchestration semantics to AchillesAgentLib.
3. AchillesCLI must preserve compatibility with AchillesAgentLib skill subsystem expectations.

Ploinky integration boundary:
1. AchillesCLI should remain compatible with workspace-managed runtime contexts.
2. Startup assumptions must avoid hardcoded machine-specific paths in core runtime logic.
3. Session/webchat runtime paths should keep durable-state assumptions aligned with orchestrated process lifecycles.
4. AchillesCLI exposes its skill catalog as MCP tools via the AgentServer mechanism. Each user skill is exposed as `execute_<sanitised_skill_name>` with an input schema derived from the skill's argument expectations. WebChat clients query this catalog at session start to populate slash-command autocomplete menus. AchillesCLI slash commands are provided through a dedicated MCP catalog tool that returns a structured command/sub-command payload and does not execute chat prompts.
5. The webchat interactive mode (`runWebchatInteractive`) accepts ESC (`\x1b`) as a standalone input line to cancel the current prompt execution. This enables remote cancel from browser-based WebChat sessions.
6. The webchat interactive mode may enable generic tag relay only through explicit launch parameters such as `--tag-relay-agent`, `--tag-relay-submit-tool`, `--tag-relay-tags`, and `--tag-relay-list-tool`. AchillesCLI must not assume a concrete downstream relay agent unless the launch context names it, and Ploinky WebChat remains only the envelope and invocation-token transport. When `--tag-relay-tags` is present, AchillesCLI uses that explicit allowlist to preserve unknown-mention fallthrough without a catalog preflight.
7. The Explorer Copilot launcher may consume agent-owned runtime plugin metadata from `file-exp:copilot-launch-extension` to add generic WebChat launch query parameters. AchillesCLI must treat those entries as configuration, not as hard-coded research-agent knowledge; the visible Explorer action remains the normal `Open Copilot here` action.

AchillesIDE interoperability boundary:
1. AchillesIDE documents a broader agent ecosystem with MCP and workspace routing expectations.
2. AchillesCLI documentation must remain explicit about what is native to CLI vs what belongs to IDE/router hosts.
3. Shared conventions (safe user output, debug gating, deterministic command behavior) must remain compatible across ecosystem tools.

Cross-repository invariants:
1. No repository should assume hidden runtime side effects from another without documented contracts.
2. Integration docs must describe boundaries and responsibilities, not duplicate entire external specs.
3. When AchillesAgentLib or host-runtime integration points change, AchillesCLI DS files must be updated in the same change set.

## Conclusion
AchillesCLI is a first-class runtime component inside a larger ecosystem; integration quality depends on explicit boundaries with Ploinky orchestration, AchillesAgentLib runtime semantics, and AchillesIDE interoperability expectations.
