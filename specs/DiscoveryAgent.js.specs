The DiscoveryAgent.js file implements the core agent discovery and execution system. It dynamically loads subagents from the subagents/ directory, analyzes user tasks to route them to appropriate subagents, performs LLM-powered code reviews of subagents, and can generate new subagents on-demand when no suitable existing agent is found. This file uses LLMClient.js for language model communications, reads subagent .js files and their corresponding .js.specs files, and is used by index.js as the main task handler. It serves as the intelligent coordinator that decides which specialized agent should handle each user request.
