The LLMClient.js file provides a unified interface for communicating with different Large Language Model providers. It imports all provider modules (anthropic.js, google.js, openai.js, huggingFace.js), routes requests to the appropriate provider based on environment variables, handles special cases for OpenAI-compatible providers (openai, openrouter, custom), and manages error handling including graceful handling of user cancellation via AbortSignal. This file is used by DiscoveryAgent.js and Coordinator.js for all LLM communications, abstracting away the provider-specific implementation details.
