The index.js file serves as the main entry point and CLI interface for the AchillesCLI application. It initializes the DiscoveryAgent, sets up the interactive command-line interface with readline, handles environment variable validation, manages chat state and history, and provides keyboard event handling (Ctrl+C to exit, Esc to cancel generation). This file uses DiscoveryAgent.js for task processing, AgentUtil.js for UI utilities like themes and animations, and coordinates the overall application flow by maintaining a chat loop where users can input commands and receive AI responses.
