It defines color themes and terminal styling constants, implements animated thinking indicators with timing and cancellation support, provides ANSI escape sequence stripping functionality for text width calculations, displays the application intro screen with ASCII art, and includes box drawing characters for UI elements. This file is used by index.js for status line display, animations, theming, and intro screen rendering, serving as the central UI utility library for the application.
