The Coordinator.js file implements an alternative orchestration system with built-in planning capabilities for complex tasks. It manages static subagents (GitAgent, NodeAgent, GeneralAgent), uses a PlanningAgent for multi-step task execution, analyzes task complexity to determine if planning is needed, and routes simple tasks directly to appropriate subagents while complex tasks go through a planning phase. This file uses LLMClient.js for routing decisions and subagent classes from the subagents/ directory. Note: This file appears to be an alternative to DiscoveryAgent.js and is not currently used in the main application flow through index.js.
